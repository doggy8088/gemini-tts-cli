Welcome to Gemini TTS batch processing demonstration.
This is the first line of text that will be converted to speech.
Here is another sentence showing how each line becomes a separate audio file.
Batch processing is useful for creating multiple audio files from a single text document.
You can use this feature for creating audio books, presentations, or educational content.
The system automatically filters out empty lines and symbol-only content.
Each line will be saved as a numbered WAV file for easy organization.
Thank you for trying the Gemini TTS batch processing example!
